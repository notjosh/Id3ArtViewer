Id3ArtViewer
============

A simple OSX application to view album art. It's mostly an experiment for using the TagLib C++ library in a Cocoa/ObjC application :)

Usage
-----

Simply drag/drop an mp3 onto the window to load the art.

Building
--------

To build, you'll need to download TagLib (I'm using 0.7, I can't promise anything else will work) from http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html and extract to 'taglib-src' in the root directory of the project.

I'm using Xcode 4.0 on 10.6 and everything is running shiny :)
